## Overview

This project showcases how to import, transform, and visualize business data in Power BI. Using data from an Excel workbook, various visualizations represent account distributions by country, industry profitability, and more. The **Business Data.pbix** file contains completed tasks based on data from **Business Data.xlsx**.

## Data Requirements

Ensure that you have the following files:
1. **Business Data.xlsx** - Contains sheets with account information, industries, and profitability metrics.
2. **Business Data.pbix** - Power BI file with all transformations and visualizations.

## Steps for Analysis

### Part 1: Account Data Analysis

1. **Import Data**: Load the "Account" sheet from **Business Data.xlsx** into Power BI.
2. **Data Transformation**: Apply transformations to prepare data for visualization.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Create a table showing account numbers by country.
   - Display account holder names by country.
   - Add a slicer to filter data by country.

4. **Save & Document**: Save the Power BI file and take screenshots of each visualization.

### Part 2: Industry & Profitability Analysis

1. **Import Additional Data**: Load the "Accounts," "Industry," and "Opportunities" sheets from **Business Data.xlsx**.
2. **Visualization**:
   - Create a table showing industry-wise profitability margins by country.

Each part includes specific visualizations:

- **Tables**: Represent counts and names by country.
- **Pie Charts**: Show profitability by industry.
- **Line & Stacked Column Charts**: Industry profitability trends.
- **Map Charts**: Geographic representation of market values and industry presence.

## Screenshots

Capture and save screenshots for documentation, showing each analysis step and visualization.
