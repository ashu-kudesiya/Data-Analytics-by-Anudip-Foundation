## Overview

This project showcases how to import, transform, and visualize business data in Power BI. Using data from an Excel workbook, various visualizations are created to represent account distributions by country, industry profitability, and more. The **Business Data.pbix** file contains all completed tasks based on data sourced from **Business Data.xlsx**.


## Requirements

Ensure that you have the following files:
1. **Business Data.xlsx** - Contains sheets with account information, industries, and profitability metrics.
2. **Business Data.pbix** - Power BI file where all tasks are performed, including data transformations and visualizations.


## Steps for Analysis

### Part 1: Account Data Analysis

1. **Import Data**: Load the "Account" sheet from the **Business Data.xlsx** file into Power BI.
2. **Data Transformation**: Apply necessary transformations to prepare the data for visualization.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Create a table to show the count of account numbers by country.
   - Add another table to display account holder names for each country.
   - Add a slicer to filter data by country.
   - Display data for specific countries: India, Brazil, Greece, and France.
4. **Save & Document**: Save the Power BI file and take screenshots of each visualization.

### Part 2: Industry & Profitability Analysis

1. **Import Additional Data**: Load the "Accounts," "Industry," and "Opportunities" sheets from **Business Data.xlsx**.
2. **Visualization**:
   - Create a table showing industry-wise profitability margins by country.
   - Use filters to allow custom country selection for industry-wise profitability margins.
   - Display industry-wise profitability using a pie chart.
   - Show profitability trends with a Line & Stacked Column chart.
   - Map industry market values and presence by country with a map chart.
3. **Save & Document**: Save the Power BI file and take screenshots of each visualization.


## Visualizations

Each part includes specific visualizations to aid analysis:

- **Tables**: Represent data in tabular format, showing counts and names by country.
- **Pie Charts**: Show profitability by industry.
- **Line & Stacked Column Charts**: Trend visualization for industry profitability.
- **Map Charts**: Geographic representation of market values and industry presence.
